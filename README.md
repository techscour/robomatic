Robomatic: A Mechanization as a Service demo
=========


This is a toy version of the TechScour Systems Mechanization
As A Service (MASS) system. It demonstrates the basic functions
of Internet soft robots including:

* specification
* search
* synthesis
* statusing
* sequencing

demo directions (linux only):

1. bundle
2. bundle exec ruby server.rb
3. sh doit.sh

These commands run a client script that demonstrates
the functions of robomatic.
